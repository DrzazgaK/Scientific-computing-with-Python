#Make a loop over integer numbers from 1 to 40.
If x is divided by 5 then print a message 'x is divided by 5'.
If x is divided by 7 then print a message 'x is divided by 7'.
If x is divided by 5 and 7 then print a message 'x is divided by 5 and 7'.
Skip x = 13.
If x is not divided by 5 and x is not divided by 7 
then print a message 'x is not important'.
Prepare two solutions with 'while' and 'for' loops.

#pierwsze for loop
for i in range(1,41):
    if i%5 == 0 and i%7 == 0:
        print(i, "is divided by 5 and 7")

    elif i%5 ==0 and i%7 != 0:
        print (i, "is divided by 5")
    elif i==13:
        pass
    else:
        print(i, "is not important")
