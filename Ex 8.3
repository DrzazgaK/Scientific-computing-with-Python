#(a) Create a two dimensional array called m1, shape=(4,5).
import numpy as np
m1=np.arange(20).reshape(4,5)
print(m1)

#(b) Create a new array m2 from m1, in which the elements of each row are in reverse order.
m2=m1[:,::-1]
print (m2)

#(c) Create a new array m3 from m1, in which the elements of each column are in reverse order.
m3=m1[::-1,:]
print(m3)

#(d) Cut of the first and last row and the first and last column of m1.
print(m1[1:3,1:4])
